==============
Burgers Static
==============

Burgers equation is the simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations (by dropping the pressure term). This equation can be investigated in one spatial dimension.
The static form of the Burgers equation is implemented in this example.


Building the example
====================

The fortran version of the example can be configured and built with CMake::

  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/burgers_static.git
  mkdir burgers_static-build
  cd burgers_static-build
  cmake -DOpenCMISSLibs_DIR=~/opencmiss/install/  ../burgers_static/
  make


Running the example
===================

Fortran version::

  cd src/fortran/
  ./burgers_static_fortran

The results can be visualised by running `visualiseBurgersStatic.cmgui <./src/fortran/visualiseBurgersStatic.cmgui>`_ with the `Cmgui visualiser <http://physiomeproject.org/software/opencmiss/cmgui/download>`_.
